# TheNoteTaker

## User Story
As the user, I want an organized page of notes to stay on top of tasks.

## Description
This webpage greets the user and sends them to a notes page that has pre-existing notes from other visits as well as opportunity to add more. Each note will have a subject that is presented on the left-hand side as a quick route to other notes saved. 

## How to Use
Be greeted with a home page that has a button to send us to our notes page when the button is clicked. From that page, existing notes' subjects are presented on the left and the right of there is space to create a new note. When that new note is ready to be saved, the save button in the bottom right will add it to the existing list.
